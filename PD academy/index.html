<p>Full Stack Development refers to the development of both front end(client side) and back end(server side) portions of web application.</p>
<p>Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code required for the application to run, including integrations with data systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data.</p>
<p>Full stack web developers have the ability to design complete web applications and websites. They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of web applications or websites.</p>
<p>Software developers require slightly different skills, tools, and software knowledge for frontend and backend development. However, full-stack development combines both disciplinesâ€”meaning teams can build applications from start to finish in an integrated and cohesive manner. A full-stack application is a software application that encompasses both frontend and backend in a single code base. </p>

<h2>Lets divide full stack into three parts:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Front End</li>
    <li>Back End</li>
    <li>Database</li>
